How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Writing maintainable, readable, and adaptable programs involves following best practices, using established design patterns, and writing modular code. In the CRUD Python module from Project One, we applied the principles of modular design by separating database operations into reusable functions. This separation allowed for easier integration of the dashboard widgets with the database in Project Two. Proper naming conventions, code documentation, and code organization also contributed to the module's readability and maintainability.

The advantages of working in this manner include easier debugging, improved reusability, and simplified future updates. The CRUD Python module can be used in other projects that require similar database operations, such as managing employee records, managing inventory, or tracking customer orders.

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist?
As a computer scientist, problem-solving starts by understanding the problem domain and the client's requirements. For Grazioso Salvare, we began by thoroughly analyzing the database and dashboard requirements. The approach in this project differed from previous assignments, as it involved not only addressing functional requirements but also focusing on non-functional aspects like maintainability, performance, and scalability.

In the future, when creating databases to meet other client requests, we will employ techniques such as:

Identifying and modeling the problem domain through ER diagrams or class diagrams.
Choosing the appropriate data storage mechanism (relational or NoSQL databases) based on the problem domain.
Implementing a well-organized, modular, and maintainable database schema.
Evaluating performance and scalability requirements and addressing them through appropriate design decisions and optimizations.
What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter?
Computer scientists study and solve complex problems in computing through the design, analysis, and implementation of software and hardware systems. They help businesses and organizations, like Grazioso Salvare, to streamline their processes, enhance decision-making, and improve overall efficiency.

Our work on this project enables Grazioso Salvare to better manage their data, providing real-time access to critical information for decision-making, and facilitating more efficient operations. By developing a well-structured, scalable, and maintainable database, we contribute to the company's ability to grow and adapt to changing business requirements, ultimately improving their overall performance and competitiveness in the market.
